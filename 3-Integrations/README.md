# Overview

Thanks to its comprehensive API, ZED cameras can be interfaced with multiple third-party libraries and environments.

| Integration     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------  |
| **[ZED Aruco](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-aruco/)** | Shows how to track or relocalize the position of one or multiple cameras using an Aruco marker. |
| **[ZED Docker](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-docker)** | Shows how to run the ZED SDK in a Docker container. |
| **[ZED GStreamer](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-gstreamer)** | Plugins to use the ZED and its SDK in a GStreamer pipeline. |
| **[ZED Matlab](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-matlab)** | Allows to use the ZED and its SDK in Matlab. |
| **[ZED OpenCV](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-opencv)** | Shows how to capture image, depth and point cloud and convert them to OpenCV format. |
| **[ZED OpenGL](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-opengl)** | Shows how to use GPU memory to display camera images and depth using OpenGL. |
| **[ZED OpenNI2](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-openni)** | OpenNI2 driver for the ZED stereo camera family. |
| **[ZED OpenPose](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-openpose)** | Uses ZED SDK and OpenPose skeleton detection to display real-time multi-person 3D pose of human bodies. |
