# Tutorials Overview

This series of basic tutorials demonstrates the use of each API module. It is recommended to start from the [first tutorial](https://github.com/adujardin/zed-examples/tree/master/1%20-%20Tutorials/tutorial%201%20-%20hello%20ZED) to get familiar with your camera. Note that no graphical window will be displayed when running these tutorials.

| Tutorial     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------  |
| **[Hello ZED](https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/tutorials/hello-zed/)** | This is the simplest tutorial. It shows how to open a stereo camera and print its serial number in the terminal. |
