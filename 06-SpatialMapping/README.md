# ZED Spatial Mapping

Spatial mapping (also called 3D reconstruction) is the ability to create a 3D map of the environment. It allows a device to understand and interact with the real world. Spatial mapping is useful for collision avoidance, motion planning, and realistic blending of the real and virtual world.
