# Examples Overview

| Sample     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------  |
| **Body Tracking** | Shows how to detect and track 3D human bodies in space and display skeletons over the live image. | 
| **Camera Control** | Shows how to adjust the ZED Camera parameters (exposure, gain, contrast, ...). | 
| **Camera Streaming** | Shows how to stream and receive a ZED Camera video feed on local network. | 
| **Depth Sensing** | Shows how to capture a 3D point cloud and display it in an OpenGL window. | 
| **Object Detection** | Shows how to use the Object Detection module with the ZED2/ZED2i/ZED-M. Two display modes are available (2D/3D). |
| **Plane Detection** | Shows how to detect floor and planar areas in the scene and draw them on the image. |
| **Positional Tracking** | Shows how to use the Positional Tracking module. The live position and orientation of the camera is displayed in a 3D window. | 
| **Spatial Mapping** | Shows how to capture a mesh with the ZED and display it with OpenGL. Classic Mesh and Point Cloud fusion are available. | 
| **SVO Recording** | Shows how to record and playback video files in SVO format. SVO files lets you use all the ZED SDK features without having a ZED connected. | 
| **Other** | Shows how to adjust the ZED Camera parameters (Exposure, Gain, Control, ...) |
